- [X] TASK20_FINAL_REVIEW: Review and verify all changes (difficulty, map size, i18n). [completed]

## Implementation Notes
- Styling should be consistent with the existing game's Material Design theme.
- **Difficulty/Map Size**:
    - Difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard.
    - Map sizes: Small, Medium, Large.
    - These selections affect game parameters (speed, grid size). Difficulty's effect on speed depends on `level-system.js` integration.
- **Internationalization (I18N)**:
    - Support Chinese (zh-CN) and English (en).
    - All user-facing text in the UI should be translatable.
    - A clear language switching mechanism (e.g., a button) should be provided.

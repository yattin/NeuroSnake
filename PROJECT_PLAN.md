## Implementation Notes
- Instructions should be clear and concise.
- Styling should be consistent with the existing game's Material Design theme.
- Initially, both languages will be displayed simultaneously. A language toggle can be a future enhancement if requested.
- **Optimization Phase**: Instructions panel to be moved to the right of the canvas, inside the main game container, with appropriate styling adjustments based on user feedback image.

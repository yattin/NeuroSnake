# Project Implementation Plan
## Project Overview
Enhance NeuroSnake game playability by implementing a local leaderboard, a basic achievement system, and a power-up system. Subsequent phases will explore new game modes and visual/audio improvements.

## Subtask List
### Phase 1: Core Gameplay Enhancements

**Leaderboard System (Local)**
- [X] `TASK_LB_01`: Design leaderboard data structure (player name, score, difficulty, map size, date). [completed]
- [X] `TASK_LB_02`: Implement logic in [`game.js`](game.js) to save scores to local storage upon game over. [completed]
- [X] `TASK_LB_03`: Create UI section in [`index.html`](index.html) to display the leaderboard. [completed]
- [X] `TASK_LB_04`: Implement logic in [`game.js`](game.js) to read and display leaderboard data from local storage. [completed]
- [X] `TASK_LB_05`: Add CSS styles in [`style.css`](style.css) for the leaderboard UI. [completed]
- [X] `TASK_LB_06`: Test leaderboard functionality: data saving, reading, display, and sorting. [completed]

**Achievement System (Basic)**
- [ ] `TASK_AC_01`: Design basic achievement data structure (ID, name, description, unlock condition, status). [current]
- [ ] `TASK_AC_02`: Integrate achievement unlock condition checks in [`game.js`](game.js) (e.g., reaching specific scores, survival time).
- [ ] `TASK_AC_03`: Create UI section in [`index.html`](index.html) to display achievements.
- [ ] `TASK_AC_04`: Implement local storage for achievement status and UI updates in [`game.js`](game.js).
- [ ] `TASK_AC_05`: Add CSS styles in [`style.css`](style.css) for the achievement UI.
- [ ] `TASK_AC_06`: Design and implement at least 3 basic achievements (e.g., "First Game", "Score > 500").
- [ ] `TASK_AC_07`: Test achievement unlocking, saving, and display.

**Power-up System (Core Mechanics & First Power-up)**
- [ ] `TASK_PW_01`: Design base power-up data structure and common logic (type, effect, duration, spawn location).
- [ ] `TASK_PW_02`: Implement power-up random spawning and despawning logic in [`game.js`](game.js).
- [ ] `TASK_PW_03`: Implement snake-power-up collision detection in [`game.js`](game.js).
- [ ] `TASK_PW_04`: Implement the first power-up: "Score Multiplier" (e.g., doubles score for 10 seconds).
    - [ ] `TASK_PW_04_A`: Implement score multiplier effect logic.
    - [ ] `TASK_PW_04_B`: (Optional) Display power-up active status/duration on UI.
- [ ] `TASK_PW_05`: Update game instructions in [`index.html`](index.html) and [`game.js`](game.js) (if text is dynamic) for the power-up system.
- [ ] `TASK_PW_06`: Test power-up spawning, collection, effect, and duration.

### Phase 2: Further Enhancements (To be detailed later)
- Additional Power-ups
- New Game Modes (e.g., Time Attack, Survival)
- Visual and Audio Enhancements

## Implementation Notes
- All new UI elements should be internationalized (EN/ZH) using the existing i18n system.
- Styling should remain consistent with the game's Material Design theme.
- Local storage will be used for leaderboard and achievement persistence.
- Ensure the `contexts` directory exists for saving task-specific contexts.

# Task Context: TASK7_OPTIMIZE_REVIEW
## Task Description
Review and verify the HTML and CSS changes made in TASK5 and TASK6 for optimizing the layout and appearance of the game instructions panel, based on user feedback and screenshot.

## Implementation Details
- **HTML Structure Review (from TASK5)**:
  - Confirmed that `.game-instructions` is now inside `.game-container`.
  - Confirmed that `#gameCanvas` and `.game-instructions` are siblings within the new `.game-main-area` div. This structure correctly supports side-by-side CSS styling.
- **CSS Styling Review (from TASK6)**:
  - `.game-main-area` uses `display: flex` for horizontal alignment of canvas and instructions, with appropriate `gap` and `align-items: flex-start`.
  - `#gameCanvas` and `.game-instructions` have `flex-shrink: 0` to maintain their dimensions.
  - `.game-instructions` has a fixed width (320px) and updated internal styling (padding, shadow, typography) for a more polished look, consistent with the screenshot's implied aesthetics.
  - The overall `.game-container` should naturally expand to fit the wider `.game-main-area`.
- **Visual Goal Alignment**:
  - The changes are designed to position the instructions panel to the right of the game canvas.
  - Styling adjustments aim for a cleaner, more integrated appearance as suggested by the user's "样式不雅观" feedback and the provided image.

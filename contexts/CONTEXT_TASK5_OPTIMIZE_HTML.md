# Task Context: TASK5_OPTIMIZE_HTML
## Task Description
Refactor `index.html` to enable a side-by-side layout for the game canvas and the instructions panel. This involves moving the `.game-instructions` div inside the main `.game-container` and wrapping both the canvas and instructions in a new parent div.

## Implementation Details
- The `.game-instructions` div, previously outside and below `.game-container`, was moved inside `.game-container`.
- A new `div` with the class `game-main-area` was created within `.game-container`, directly under the `.ui-panel`.
- The `<canvas id="gameCanvas"></canvas>` was moved into this new `game-main-area`.
- The (now relocated) `.game-instructions` div was also moved into `game-main-area`, as a sibling to the canvas.
- This structural change prepares the HTML for CSS modifications in TASK6 to achieve the side-by-side layout.
- The `edit_block` function was used for this modification.

## File Changes
- Modified: `C:\codes\ai-tools\demo6\index.html`

## Notes
- The HTML structure is now set up for flexbox or grid layout to position canvas and instructions side-by-side.
- All instruction content remains the same, only its position in the DOM tree has changed.

## Status Summary
- TASK5 is completed. `index.html` has been refactored.
- Next step is TASK6: Update `style.css` to implement the new layout and visual style.

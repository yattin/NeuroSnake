# Task Context: TASK4
## Task Description
Review and verify the changes made to `index.html` and `style.css` for adding bilingual game instructions. This includes checking for correctness, consistency, and potential issues.

## Implementation Details
- **HTML Review**:
  - The new `div.game-instructions` section was correctly inserted into `index.html`.
  - Structure for English (`.instructions-en`) and Chinese (`.instructions-zh`) instructions is sound.
  - Content matches the drafted instructions from TASK1.
- **CSS Review**:
  - Styles for `.game-instructions` and its children were added to `style.css`.
  - Styling (colors, fonts, shadows, spacing) aligns with the existing Material Design theme (e.g., `.game-container`).
  - Layout properties aim to position the instruction block below the game container and centered.
- **Functional Verification (Theoretical)**:
  - The added elements are static and should not interfere with game JavaScript.
  - Both language versions will be displayed simultaneously as per plan.

## File Changes
- No new file changes in this task. This task is a review of changes made in TASK2 and TASK3.

## Notes
- The changes appear correct and complete based on the requirements.
- User should visually test in a browser to confirm the layout and styling on different screen sizes.
- No new JavaScript functionality was introduced or modified.

## Status Summary
- TASK4 is completed. Code changes have been reviewed.
- All planned subtasks for adding bilingual game instructions are now complete.

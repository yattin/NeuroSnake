# Task Context: TASK_LB_03
## Task Description
Create UI section in [`index.html`](index.html:1) to display the leaderboard.

## Implementation Details
- Added a new `div` with class `leaderboard-section card` inside the `game-main-area` div, after the `game-instructions` div.
- Inside `leaderboard-section`:
    - Added an `h3` element with `data-i18n-key="leaderboardTitle"` for the leaderboard title.
    - Added an `ol` element with `id="leaderboardList"` to serve as a container for leaderboard entries. JavaScript will populate this list.

## File Changes
- Modified [`index.html`](index.html:1):
    - Inserted the following HTML block after line 55 (closing `</div>` of `game-instructions`):
      ```html
            <div class="leaderboard-section card">
                <h3 data-i18n-key="leaderboardTitle">Leaderboard</h3>
                <ol id="leaderboardList">
                    <!-- Leaderboard entries will be populated by JavaScript -->
                </ol>
            </div>
      ```

## Notes
- The `card` class is used to maintain visual consistency with other UI elements like game instructions.
- The `data-i18n-key` attribute is added to the title for internationalization.
- The actual list items (`<li>`) will be generated dynamically by JavaScript in a subsequent task (`TASK_LB_04`).

## Status Summary
The UI section for the leaderboard has been added to [`index.html`](index.html:1). Ready for `TASK_LB_04`.
